7. Add 600μl of PW buffer in CP3 spin column and centrifuge for 30 – 60s (12,000 rpm). Discard waste in collection tube and return CP3 spin column back in collection tube. <br>
8. Repeat step 7. <br>
9. Place CP3 spin column in collection tube and centrifuge for 2mins (12,000 rpm) to clean remaining PW buffer. Open the CP3 spin column lid and rest in room temperature to evaporate remaining ethanol. <br>
10. Place the CP3 spin column in a clean microcentrifuge tube. Add 50-100 μl of EB buffer to the center of the CP3 spin column, and rest for 2 minutes, then centrifuge for 2mins (12,000 rpm). <br>

<h3>Gel Preparation</h3>
            <div class="text">
              <font size="+1">1. Clean and completely dry the plates, combs, and any other experiment materials. Assemble the system according to manufacturer’s instruction. <br>
2. Prepare the separating gel solution according to the following formula. Ammonium persulfate and TEMED are added when the gel is ready to be polymerized, stir gently, then immediately apply to the sandwich until the gel height is lower 1.5 cm than the short plate. Allowing the gel to polymerize 30~60min by covering gently with a layer of water (1cm). <br>
3. Until a sharp optical discontinuity at the water/gel interface is visible, pour off the water. <br>
4. Prepare the stacking gel solution in a similar way to the separating gel. Insert the comb and allow the gel to polymerize completely.
